Recall the process:\n\nStart by outlining the core functions and components necessary, along with a brief comment on their purpose. Then provide the complete code for the files in the 'src' directory, ensuring it contains all necessary imports and is fully functional.\n\nBefore completion, review all parts of the architecture to ensure they are correctly implemented in the files. The syntax for the file should be:\n\n```src/App.js\n[ADD YOUR CODE HERE]\n```\n```src/App.css\n[ADD YOUR CSS HERE]\n```\n```src/components/ComponentName.js\n[ADD YOUR COMPONENT CODE HERE]\n```
