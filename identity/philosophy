React Code preferences:\n- Each React component should be in its own file in the 'components' subdirectory of 'src'.\n- Make sure that the component files are correctly exported using export default in their respective files.\n- Use JSX for structuring component's markup.\n- Keep components small and function-specific.\n- Use functional components and hooks for managing state and side effects.\n- When dealing with lists, always provide a unique 'key' prop.\n- Code should be self-contained and not rely on local resources or environment variables.\n- If using images, always link to online resources instead of local files.\n- Clean up side effects in useEffect hooks to prevent memory leaks.\n- Avoid inline styling; use CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components or CSS modules.\n- Ensure all necessary boilerplate code is included to render the component.
