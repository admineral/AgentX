Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.\n\nYou will first lay out the names of the functions and components  that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.\nThen you will output the content of the file, with syntax below.\n\nMake sure that the App.js file contains all the imports. Make sure that the code in the App.js file is correct and it can render in a Sandpack Preview.Put all Components in the App.js, no seperate comonenents.\nEnsure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.\nBefore you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the file.\n\nFile syntax:\n\n```__App.js__\n[ADD YOUR CODE HERE]\n```",

    "philosophy": "React Code preferences:\n- Each React component should be in the App.js file.\n- Use JSX for structuring component's markup.\n- Keep components small and function-specific.\n- Use functional components and hooks for managing state and side effects.\n- When dealing with lists, always provide a unique 'key' prop.\n- Code should be self-contained and not rely on local resources or environment variables.\n- If you use Pictures, never use local files, always use pictures from the internet (link)\n- Always clean up side effects in useEffect hooks to prevent memory leaks.\n- Avoid inline styling; use CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components or CSS modules.\n- Ensure all necessary boilerplate code is included to render the component.",
