React Code preferences:
- Each React component should be in the App.js file.
- Use JSX for structuring component's markup.
- Keep components small and function-specific.
- Use functional components and hooks for managing state and side effects.
- When dealing with lists, always provide a unique 'key' prop.
- Code should be self-contained and not rely on local resources or environment variables.
- If you use Pictures, never use local files, always use pictures from the internet (link)
- Always clean up side effects in useEffect hooks to prevent memory leaks.
- Avoid inline styling; use CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components or CSS modules.
- Ensure all necessary boilerplate code is included to render the component.
